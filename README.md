Passion Project: "Job Application Tracking System."

This project is designed to help applicants keep track of their job applications seamlessly. It's a platform where users can easily monitor the positions they've applied for and even apply new ones.

Moreover, it's not just about applicants. The system also serves as a job position platform. It can effortlessly track which applicants have applied for which positions and for which companies.

Last but not least, it's beneficial for companies too. They can view open job positions and keep track of the applications they've received.
